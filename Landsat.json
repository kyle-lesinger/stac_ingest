This RGB uses a shortwave, the near-infrared, and red channels from the instrument.Color Infrared: The Color Infrared composite is created using the near-infrared, red, and green channels, allowing for the ability to see areas impacted from the fires. The near-infrared gives the ability to see through thin clouds. Healthy vegetation is shown as red, water is in blue.True Color: The True Color RGB composite provides a product of how the surface would look to the naked eye from space. The RGB is created using the red, green, and blue channels of the respective instrument.Suggested Use:Natural Color: areas of water will appear blue, healthy green vegetation will appear as a bright green, urban areas in various shades of magenta.Color Infrared: depicts healthy vegetation as red, water as blue. Some minor atmospheric corrections have occurred.True Color: provides a product of how the surface would look to the naked eye from space. The True Color RGB is produced using the 3 visible wavelength bands (red, green, and blue) from the respective sensor. Some minor atmospheric corrections have occurred.Satellite/Sensor:Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager (OLI)Resolution:30 metersCredits:NASA/MSFC, USGSEsri REST Endpoint:See URL section on right side of pageWMS Endpoint:https://maps.disasters.nasa.gov/ags03/services/california_wildfires_202501/Landsat/MapServer/WMSServerData Download:https://maps.disasters.nasa.gov/download/gis_products/event_specific/2025/california_wildfires_202501/landsat/",
